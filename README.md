# Supplier OTIF & Cost-to-Serve Analytics Dashboard

## 1. Problem
Organizations struggle to understand which suppliers are truly reliable when it comes to on-time, in-full deliveries and true end-to-end cost. This project builds a supplier analytics dashboard to track OTIF, lead time variability, invoice accuracy, and cost-to-serve to support sourcing and supplier consolidation decisions.

## 2. Role & Context
Built as part of my Supply Chain & Operations portfolio, inspired by my experience automating shipment and supplier KPI dashboards for 2000+ shipments/month at a global logistics leader.

## 3. Data
- 1,000+ purchase order records (synthetic)
- Key fields: supplier, region, promised vs actual delivery dates, OTIF flag, cost components, invoice errors

## 4. Metrics
- OTIF %
- Lead time variance
- Invoice accuracy %
- Cost-to-serve per supplier
- ABC supplier segmentation by spend

## 5. Tools
- Power BI
- Excel / CSV
- (Optional) Python / SQL for preprocessing

## 6. Highlights
- Identified low-performance, high-cost suppliers
- Quantified cost-to-serve and improvement opportunities
- Supports sourcing and consolidation decisions
